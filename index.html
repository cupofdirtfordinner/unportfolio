          <p>I really like how this started, but I never got to finish it because my laptop conked out and I haven't figured out how to put that ssd in my new pc. A real D colon</p>

          <p>this thing has a ton of weird issues (like the limbs being one bending bone) but other than that I think this is a really clean animation that I made completely without references or anything so I'm quite proud</p>
